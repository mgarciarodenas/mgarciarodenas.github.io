Welcome! I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Modern and Contemporary Spanish Literature and Cultural Studies at Whitman College (2025–2026).

I hold a PhD and MA in Hispanic Studies from Georgetown University, as well as an MA in Hispanic Studies from Auburn University. My academic journey began in Spain, where I completed both an MA and a BA in English Studies at the Universitat de València and UNED.


Future Projects
======
My research explores contemporary literature, film, and cultural production from Global Spain, with a particular emphasis on the Environmental and Medical Humanities. I am especially interested in topics such as rural myth and folklore, narratives of the Spanish Civil War, and the representation of women and other marginalized communities. As a comparativist, I am passionate about Iberian cultural studies and enjoy engaging with diverse perspectives across disciplines.
